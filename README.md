I am Gaetano, a software engineer from Italy, now living in London. I work with blockchain technology and have a strong interest in legal tech. When I‚Äôm not coding, I like to come up with new ideas for crypto projects and often spend time filling whiteboards with my thoughts.

</summary>
Poliapp, born in a uni caf√© and built over a summer, is the unofficial app for Politecnico di Torino students. It was a digital Swiss Army knife, packing everything from course materials to schedule and email, all wrapped in a user-friendly design that makes the official uni website look bad, particularly on 2015 smartphones. We even turned it into Hogwarts for April's fool day, because who doesn't want a bit of magic in their student life? üè∞

</summary>
DoorOnPhone: It's like giving your old-school intercom a dose of Steve Jobs' magic. Inspired by the iPhone's wizardry, I spiced up the mundane intercom into a tech marvel with video streaming, remote control, virtual keys, and, the cherry on top, face recognition. Diving into Python (because let's face it, C and C++ are so last season), I crafted this feature and teamed up with a design guru to give it some serious style. From a 'Eureka!' moment staring at an ancient intercom to showcasing our snazzy prototype at I3P in Turin, DoorOnPhone is where design meets doorstep tech, reinventing the way we answer the door!
