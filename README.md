I am Gaetano, a software engineer from Italy based in London.
I am a software engineer and a specialist in legal technology. When not coding I spend time filling endless whiteboards with new ideas for crypto projects.

ü•á POLYGON HACKATHON WINNER PROJECT 2020

Ethereum isn't just currency, it's the gold in our digital age. Tokens? They're not mere assets; they transform into sparkling gems in your unique NFT ring. Forge these elements together to create a piece of digital jewelry. If it doesn't quite match your style, simply melt it down and take the precious assets back!

  In Italy, we celebrate graduation by donning laurel hats, just like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/09/18/how-often-do-men-think-about-the-roman-empire-a-lot-according-to-new-tiktok-trend/">Ancient Romans</a>. To add a cool twist, I thought, why not mount one on a drone and have it floating above my head, following me around  Lesson learned: adding leaves to a drone changes its inertia and messes with the controller. Plus, the wind, along with the leaves can invalidate all indoor testing

</summary>
Poliapp, born in a uni caf√© and built over a summer, is the unofficial app for Politecnico di Torino students. It was a digital Swiss Army knife, packing everything from course materials to schedule and email, all wrapped in a user-friendly design that makes the official uni website look bad, particularly on 2015 smartphones. We even turned it into Hogwarts for April's fool day, because who doesn't want a bit of magic in their student life? üè∞

</summary>
DoorOnPhone: It's like giving your old-school intercom a dose of Steve Jobs' magic. Inspired by the iPhone's wizardry, I spiced up the mundane intercom into a tech marvel with video streaming, remote control, virtual keys, and, the cherry on top, face recognition. Diving into Python (because let's face it, C and C++ are so last season), I crafted this feature and teamed up with a design guru to give it some serious style. From a 'Eureka!' moment staring at an ancient intercom to showcasing our snazzy prototype at I3P in Turin, DoorOnPhone is where design meets doorstep tech, reinventing the way we answer the door!
